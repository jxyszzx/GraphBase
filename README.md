# GraphBase
This is a repository to maintain some representative graph algorithms

## Algorithms
### Label Propagation Algorithm
* location
  * You can find it in Flash/lpa
* how to use it
  * compile
    * `make`
  * run
    * `./main sample.txt 100`
    * where sample.txt is in Flash/datasets, and 100 is the cycles for the lpa
